        <h1 id="DP"> Digit DP Basic </h1>

        Digit dp is a very easy technique and also useful to solve many dynamic programming problems. <br /> <br />
        Seeing the name “Digit DP” it’s easy to guess that we are going to do something using the digits. <br /> <br />
        Yes we are actually going toplay with digits. <br /> <br />
        Let’s explain the concept using a classical problem. <br /> <br />

    <div>
        Problem How many numbers x are there in the range a to b, where the digit d occurs exactly k times in x? <br />
        <br />
        There may have several solutions including number theory or combinatorics, <br /> <br />
        but let’s see how we can solve this problem using digit dp. <br /> <br />
    </div>

    <div>
        Solve for range (zero to a) <br /> <br />
        Using digit dp we always focus on building a number satisfying all the conditions. <br /> <br />
        If we finally manage to buildthat number then we say, yes we have got one ;-) <br /> <br />
        But how we’ll build that number? For the time being let’s say a is zero. <br /> <br />
        So we need to find the total numbers which are not greater than b and also satisfy the given conditions. <br />
        <br />

    <div>
        Building a sequence of digits <br /> <br />
        Let’s consider the number as a sequence of digits. <br /> <br />
        Let’s name the sequence sq. Initially sq is empty. <br /> <br />
        We’ll try to add new digits from left to right to build the sequence. <br /> <br />
        In each recursive call we’ll place a digit in our current position and will call recursively to add a digit in
        the next position. <br /> <br />
        But can we place any of the digits from 0 to 9 in our current position? <br /> <br />
        Of course not, because we need to make sure that the number is not
        getting larger than b. <br /> <br />
    </div>

    <div>
        Information we need to place a digit at the current position <br /> <br />
        Let’s say during the building of the sequence, currently we are at position pos. <br /> <br />
        We have already placed some digits in position from 1 to pos-1. <br /> <br />
        So now we are trying to place a digit at current position pos. <br /> <br />
        If we knew the whole sequence we have build so far till position pos-1 then we could easily find out which
        digits we can
        place now. <br /> <br />
        But how... <br /> <br />
